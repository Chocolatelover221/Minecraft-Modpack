# The Modlist!

The full modlist. This will be subdivided into categories. Main mods are the mods that actually do things.
Optional mods are ones you can choose to use during installation, using the installer.
APIs & Libraries are mods that are just there for other mods needed to work. 
They don't do much else other than add to the mod count.  And finally, Utility mods are mods that are small, but are really useful.
Mods marked with a \* are mods that are found in the Modpack-bigmods repository, if you are looking for the files. Now, onto it.
